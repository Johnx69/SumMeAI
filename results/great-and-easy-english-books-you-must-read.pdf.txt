 Reading English novels is a great way to improve language skills, as it helps with vocabulary, understanding, and knowledge of different cultures. It is also an enjoyable and relaxing way to learn. Charlotte's Web by E.B. White, Mieko and the Fifth Treasure, The House On Mango Street, and The Giver are some great books for EFL learners. In The House On Mango Street, Ponyboy and Cherry meet and discover they have a lot in common despite being from different gangs. In Esperanza, a Mexican girl living in a new home on Mango Street in a busy Latino area of Chicago, the novel follows her life over the course of one year. In Clay Jensen's story, he finds a parcel at his front door containing 7 cassette tapes from his previous classmate, Hannah Baker, who has committed suicide. Peter Pan by J.M. Barrie is a classic story that is enjoyed by both children and adults. In A Wrinkle In Time by Madeline L'engle, Meg and her siblings travel through the universe using a "tesseract" and encounter the "Black thing" (the devil). Reading is a great way to improve English and learn new vocabulary.
